# PriorityQueue-Processes
The program is suppose to add or removed processes into and out of a binary tree. The binary tree is sorted using a PCB's priority number (1 - 50), where the higher the number the higher priority it has. I used my binary tree source code from CS311. I was the only one to worked on it, no one else helped. The binary tree is organized with the higher the number being on the left side and smaller number being on the right side. I used a queue from the library to handle PCB with duplicate Priority values. I plan to put all the Ready state PCB elements towards the back of the PCBTable and the NonReady PCB elements in the beginning with a variable keeping track of the middle.
